# Notes on using this file:
#
# DATES
# Dates must be formatted in a strict YYYY-MM-DD format, meaning you have to put
# a 0 in front of any single digit month or day numbers.
#
# For instance, the 6th of August 2020 would be 2020-08-06. Without the extra
# leading zero, this script won't work.
#
# DAYS OF THE WEEK
# Days of the week, for the meeting key and for the is_a key in redefined, must
# be written in all lower case. Days can have the following values:
#
# - monday
# - tuesday
# - wednesday
# - thursday
# - friday
# - saturday
#
# NAMES OF WEEKS
# For the weeks key, due to a quirk in how YAML works, the number of the week (
# e.g. week 1 or week 12) has to be in quotes. I know it's strange.
